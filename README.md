# 👋 Hey there! I'm a Junior Dev on a Mission

I'm an independent, self-driven **Frontend Developer** passionate about building clean, interactive, and multilingual web experiences. I'm currently expanding my skills beyond frontend by learning **Go** and **C#** to deepen my backend and systems knowledge.

## 💡 What Drives Me

- Constantly learning, experimenting, and pushing my limits
- Building things that are fast, accessible, and visually engaging
- Designing thoughtful user experiences with attention to detail
- Making things work well on *all* devices — even low-end ones
- Keeping things clean: in code, design, and project structure

## 🧠 What I’m Learning

- **Go** and **C#** – diving into both for their power and structure  
- **System design** and scalable app architecture  
- **CI/CD pipelines** and DevOps workflows  
- **Security** with JWTs, CORS, and protected routes  
- **Performance optimizations** for smooth UX across devices
